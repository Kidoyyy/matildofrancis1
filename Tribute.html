        <b>Gemma Rabanes Matildo</b> (born on January 27, 1667) She is a loving mother of four and a hardworking wife. No one compares to the unconditional love she gave to her family. She dedicated 32 years working at Commission on Population. Her desire to succeed in life has allowed her to grow into a lovely woman full of wisdom and kindness. She enjoys dancing, singing, and cooks so well. She always has a cheerful attitude and a smile on her face when she wakes up. Everyone admires her for her bravery, kindness, friendliness, and compassion. She is the most important person to me. She is my inspiration to work hard and become better every day. She made me laugh so hard that I've cried numerous times, and it's only one of the many reasons why I adore her. She is everything to me. And now that she's battling cancer, I know it's hard for her, but I've never seen her complain or give up. She endured all the pain and never lost hope that God would heal her one day. I want her to know that she is the most beautiful woman Iâ€™ve ever known. She is the best and a supermom indeed.
        As a son, mum is often the first person who inspires and guides you on your way into womanhood. Make sure to let her know how wonderful she is at dealing with boy trouble, being a safe place when things go wrong and putting up with the teenage tantrums!</p>
